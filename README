--- Rhino runner note -------------------------------------------------------

This is a special branch containing an extended Rhino runner of the one that
was included upstream but is now removed.

This project is intended to provide the original upstream along with this
runner.

Bugfixes and suggestions should be targeted here:

fulljslint.js contains the fully commented JSLINT function.

fulljslint.html runs the JSLINT function in a web page. The page also depends
on adsafe.js [www.ADsafe.org] and json2.js [www.JSON.org] (which are not
included in this project) and intercept.js and fullinit_ui.js (which are). The
js files should all be minified, and all except fullinit_ui.js are concatenated
together to form fullwebjslint.js.

intercept.js augments ADsafe, giving widgets access to cookies and the JSLINT
function.

fullinit_ui.js hooks the HTML ui components to ADsafe.

lint.html describes JSLint's usage.

JSLint can be run anywhere that JavaScript (or Java) can run. See for example
